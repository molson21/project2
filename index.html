            <!--Introduction-->
            <p>Thinking of giving your room a fresh coat of paint? Why not add a touch of feline flair to the mix? Follow these steps to celebrate the unpredictable charm of having a cat as your painting buddy. Embrace the delightful chaos as we guide you through the colorful journey of room painting with your furry assistant. Let’s turn your bedroom into a cat-tastic masterpiece, one fuzzy paw at a time!</p>
            
            <h2>Step 1: Unboxing Your Cat</h2>
            <img src="unbox.jpg" width="300" alt="A black cat is lying down inside a partially open cardboard box filled with crumpled brown packing paper. The cat looks relaxed, with its head resting on the edge of the paper and its green eyes gazing forward. The box is on a carpeted floor indoors." class="photo">
            <br>
            <p class="process">Before any painting project can begin, it's crucial to properly unbox your feline assistant. As we all know, a cat’s natural habitat is any box that appears, so gently remove your kitty from their cardboard kingdom. This step ensures they’re ready to "supervise" every brushstroke and offer a helpful paw.</p>
            
            <h2>Step 2: Preparing Your Cat for the Task Ahead</h2>
            <img src="fancycat.jpg" width="300" alt="A black cat with green eyes sits on a light beige carpet, looking directly at the camera. Its ears are perked up, and its tail is curled around its body. The lighting softly highlights the cat's fur and bright eyes."  class="photo">
            <br>
            <p class="process">After unboxing, it's time for your cat to get into the zone. Notice their intense, focused stare. This is the look of a true professional. Whether they're planning the perfect paint swatch or just contemplating their next nap, this preparation phase is essential. Make sure to give them a moment to gather their thoughts (and strike a pose) before diving into the project.</p>
            
            <h2>Step 3: Supplying Your Cat with the Right Tools</h2>
            <img src="friends.jpg" width="300" alt="A black cat with wide green eyes lies on its side on a beige carpet, hugging a green pool noodle with its front paws. Surrounding the cat is a white fabric on one side and parts of a wooden object on the other." class="photo">
            <br>
            <p id="largephoto">Every expert assistant needs the right tools, and your cat is no exception! Equip your furry helper with a foam roller. While they lounge beside it, you'll know they're ready to "assist" with precision and flair. Remember, a well-prepared cat is the key to a purr-fectly painted room!</p>
            
            <h2>Step 4: Supervising from Below</h2>
            <img src="ladder.jpg" width="300" alt="A wooden step ladder is set up in front of a green wall with a light switch socket exposed. A black cat is sitting underneath the ladder. The ladder holds a cup, tape rolls, and a small container. A green foam roller lies on the carpet nearby." class="photo">
            <br>
            <p class="process">No painting project is complete without your cat taking up a strategic position. Under the ladder is the perfect spot for overseeing all the action from a safe vantage point. Their keen eyes will ensure that no detail goes unnoticed and that you’re following all the steps correctly. Plus, it’s the ideal place for a quick catnap between rounds of supervision!</p>
            
            <h2>Step 5: The Final Inspection</h2>
            <img src="thestare.jpg" width="300" alt="A black cat with yellow-green eyes lies on a beige carpet, looking attentively to the right. The background consists of a teal-colored wall and a wooden baseboard." class="photo">
            <br>
            <p class="process">With the painting complete, it’s time for the final inspection. Your cat, positioned thoughtfully, will survey the freshly painted walls. Their approving gaze (or indifferent glance) signifies a job well done. Take a moment to admire your work—and your feline assistant’s invaluable contributions to this masterpiece!</p>
            
            <h2 id="results">The Results</h2>
            <img src="before.jpg" width="500" alt="A room with a solid maroon accent wall. The other walls are a pale green. A wooden stepladder stands against the maroon wall, and a vacuum cleaner is positioned nearby on the light-colored carpeted floor." class="beforeafter">
